# Notes to the Reviewer

1. First of all, I'd like to apologize because I only started working on this test project today at midnight, I can only focus on architecting the codes to (hopefully) follow the clean architecture by separating the modules and components accordingly, and I use a very standard looking layout for the User Interface.

2. At first I was planning on not using a third party library for this project because so far, it is quite simple. But again, because of the time limit, I decided to use the KingFisher library for image loader.
